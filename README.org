* ESPSchedule

ESPRIT Student? Harness the power of the shell to retrieve this week's schedule.

This repository hosts two scripts:
- [[file:src/sched_get.py][sched_get.py]]: authenticates to the website, obtains the latest schedule and downloads it.
- [[file:src/sched_extract.sh][sched_extract.sh]]: extracts the relevant schedule from the initial PDF and overwrites it.

** Prerequisites

- =bash=
- =moreutils=
- =python3=
- =python-beautifulsoup4=
- =python-requests=

** Usage

Navigate to the =src/= directory.
#+begin_src sh
cd src/
#+end_src

Open the =sched_get.py= file and modify the =username=, =password= and
=my_class= variables accordingly - you only have to do this once.

Run =sched_get.py=.
#+begin_src sh
python3 sched_get.py
#+end_src

=schedule.pdf= should now appear in your working directory.
